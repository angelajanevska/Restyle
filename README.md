# Restyle
Second hand online shop which offers selling and buying used clothes.
# Our mission
We want to motivate people to recycle the clothes they do not use, instead of throwing them away as they will probably end up in the landfill, or to buy already used clothes, which helps lower the overall demand for new clothing to be produced.
Our application gives clothes a second chance to be loved and used by someone else.
